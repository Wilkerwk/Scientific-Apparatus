I2C Sensors Intro
=================


This is a technique which allows many sensors to be connected at once while minimizing the total number of required wires.  

This is fantastic whenever you do not need constant full-duplex interaction with your sensor (i.e. as long as a few say 100ms between readings is permissible).
